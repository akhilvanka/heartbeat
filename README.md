# Heartbeat

Heartbeat is a simple and lightweight service designed to monitor the availability of domains being handled by the Caddy web server. It parses the `/etc/Caddyfile` to identify all configured domains and checks their status, reporting whether they are up or down.

## Features

- **Domain Availability Monitoring**: Heartbeat scans the Caddy configuration file to identify domains configured for reverse proxy and checks their availability.

- **Up/Down Reporting**: The service reports the status of each domain, indicating whether it is up or down.

## Warning!
This is a niche tool I developed for my own servers, and as such do download the source code and tailor its usage to your own servers/services.
